# interfaceAndGenericsProject
A school project that helped in my understanding of interfaces and generic data types in Java.
The HashNumSet and ListNode classes are my implementation of the template given in the other classes.
The project is designed to create a list of numbers, and to add a number to that list if it is does not exist in the list. 
This can be done with multiple data type entries (int, double, float, short), and the length of the list doubles when its capacity has been reached.
